This is a buying and selling app in design phase being built for android lollipop.
The allignment of components ie buttons and text, in different devices is very different and badly ordered probably due to not using constraint layout.
The navigation drawer lags while opening in phone and its movement is not smooth.
I'm working on these issues.
Since i'm new to android development, suggestions and changes are more than welcome. :)
